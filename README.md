<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>

I'm a junior developer that has recently completed Makers Academy, a 4 month, intensive training programme for junior developers moving into coding from other sectors. Prior to embarking on my career in programming, I have five years experience as a senior project manager in healthcare. Initially inspired to turn to coding by my experience of building a website for a surf house, I’m now looking to build a career in software development- fullstack or front end.

**Getting stuff done**

_Code:_ In a recent project [The app of Gnar] (https://github.com/sara6/The-app-of-GNAR) we were able to ensure that all the features we had set out at the beginning of the design stage were delivered. Whilst this was mostly to do with working with three other awesome people, it was through regular stand-ups and Waffle reviews that we were focused and organised.

_Work:_ Getting stuff done is what has endeared me most to the organisations I have previously worked for. I have found that being clear and direct as well as emphatetic has helped mitigate breakdowns in communication and wider project issues.

_Non-code or work:_ Being upfront, I can procrastinate on Sunday’s on BBCiplayer. However, I’m an avid potter and have made about 8 mis-matched dinner sets over the past 5 years.

**Communication**

_Code:_ At Makers Academy we pair programmed everyday and I learnt that coding effectively meant communicating clearly and often, and adapting to how different people preferred to work. It is something I would like to maintain going forward.

_Work:_ Communication was the key skill in my previous role. I was the lead NHS Project Manager responsible for a £12m hospital portfolio in addition to opening the first therapy centres for the organisation. I’m immensely proud of what we opened and would argue that it was my communication with my team members that assisted it more than anything else.

_Non-code or work:_ I love surfing and my communication is concise and clear when someone drops in on me (takes a wave that I’ve waited/ queued for in a line up).
